# English to Devanagari Transliteration

This project implements a character-level machine learning system to transliterate
English (Romanized) text into Devanagari script.

The focus is on transliteration (script conversion), not translation, preserving
pronunciation while changing scripts.

Details on dataset, preprocessing, model architecture, training, and inference
will be added.
